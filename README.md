Written for Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.)

- ARROWS
This folder contains code and two different trial lists enabling counterbalanced stimulus presentation. Picture stimuli are not included as they were from the International Affective Picture Stimuli (IAPS), available from http://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/. Further details will be published in a forthcoming manuscript (Tamm et al, in preparation).

- FACES
This folder contains code and two different trial lists enabling counterbalanced stimulus presentation. Picture stimuli are not included as they were from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, available from http://www.emotionlab.se/resources/kdef. Further details will be published in a forthcoming manuscript (Nilsonne et al, in preparation).

- HANDS
This folder contains code and two different trial lists enabling counterbalanced stimulus presentation. Picture stimuli are not included as they were made avaliable to us courtesy of Claus Lamm. Further details will be published in a forthcoming manuscript (Tamm et al, in preparation).

- KSS
This folder contains code to run the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) several times. 

- RestingState_1
This experimental paradigm merely shows a fixation cross for 8 minutes

- RestingState_2
This experimental paradigm shows the same fixation cross as in RestingState_1, but also adds a KSS rating every second minute.
